    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

    <p>
      ReelTime is a personal mobile application developed for entertainment
      purposes. Your privacy is important, and this Privacy Policy explains how
      information is handled when you use the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      ReelTime does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable
      information. The app does not require user registration or account creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app accesses publicly available third-party movie APIs to display movie
      information such as titles, descriptions, and images. This data is fetched
      in real time and is not stored on any backend servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Any temporary data (such as cached images) is stored locally on your device
      to improve performance. This data can be removed at any time by clearing the
      app’s storage or uninstalling the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      ReelTime may use third-party services to retrieve movie-related content.
      These services operate under their own privacy policies, and ReelTime does
      not control how they collect or use data.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      Reasonable measures are taken to protect information processed by the app.
      However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage
      is completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      ReelTime does not knowingly collect personal information from children under
      the age of 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be
      reflected on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>

      If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you may contact the
      developer at:
